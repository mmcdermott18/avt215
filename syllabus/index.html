                <h3>prerequisites</h3>
                <p>AVT 104: Studio Fundamentals I and AVT 180: New Media in the Creative Arts — or permission of instructor with portfolio review.</p>
                <h3>course description</h3>
                <p>Introduction to history and use of type. Reading and projects develop awareness of type as a linguistic and visual communication tool. Introduces typographic design elements, including color, hierarchy, integration with imagery, structure, and content. Fulfills general education requirement in arts.</p>
                <h3>objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognize the importance of proper use of typography in visual communication</li>
                    <li>Understand the anatomy and evolution of the roman letterform</li>
                    <li>Understand the history of printing and its contribution to graphic design</li>
                    <li>Develop essential craft, critique and presentation skills</li>
                    <li>Learn and apply basic layout skills in InDesign</li>
                    <li>Understand and explore the use of grid systems</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>content</h3>
                <p>AVT 215 is not a graphic software training class—students must demonstrate proficient skills in Adobe Creative Suite programs Illustrator and Photoshop by completing the AVT 180 prerequisite or passing a software test. There will be some technical demonstrations throughout the semester, and I will also be available as a resource to help with project-specific challenges. Through lecture, studio and computer lab time, students will learn typographic principles using hand rendering as well as software on the Macintosh platform. Students will develop a series of projects and exercises  from initial sketches to final presentation.</p>
                <h3>overview</h3>
                <p>Type is everywhere. The only way to avoid it is to close your eyes and even then you still might see it. During this class we will start by looking at the form and structure of letters and then combine those letters to make words, sentences and paragraphs. We will make type by hand, print type digitally, and set type to be viewed on screen. We will learn that the style, weight, size, and color of the type we choose can say just as much as the words we write with it. We will also have various exercises and demos during class to improve your skills and knowledge of the tools available to you. Finally we will talk about the anatomy of type, the history of type, and the type designers who create the type. By the end of the class you will have a strong basis in the fundamentals of typography to use in your evolving design practice.</p>
                <h3>attendance and participation</h3>
                <p>You must be physically, mentally and verbally present and prepared. Punctuality is of prime importance. There are few good excuses for being late to class, try and be as early as you can. Tardiness will also affect your final grade—three late arrivals equals an absence. Please come to class prepared and ready to work for the entire scheduled time. Being prepared includes having all work printed and ready to discuss. You are expected to attend all meetings of each class. Unexcused absences from three classes will result in a failing grade.</p>
                <h3>discussion of work</h3>
                <p>You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to talk about your work and other student’s work is a very important part of your education at GMU. Use this class to improve on those skills too.</p>
                <h3>grading</h3>
                <p>Your grade will depend on your attendance (20%), your participation(15%), your craft(15%), your process (25%), and the completion of all the projects by the end of the class (25%). Below is a more specific breakdown.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A - Strong design process, ability to come up with many different ways to solve a problem, excellent research, mastery of form, functionality, and craftsmanship, frequent participation in critiques and discussions, strong work ethic, focused, energetic, ability to articulate ideas, resourceful.</li>
                    <li>B - Solid, well-done work, could improve on items noted in A list, in particular, better process, more solutions, better craft and attention to detail, more class participation.</li>
                    <li>C - Does average work, fulfills assignments but not much else, frequently late, little or no class participation, not willing to re-work or refine projects.</li>
                    <li>D - Limited effort, incomplete work, lack of skill and enthusiasm, chronic tardiness and unexcused absences.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>students with disabilities and learning differences</h3>
                <p>If you have a diagnosed disability or learning difference and you need academic accommodations, please inform me at the beginning of the semester and contact the Disabilities Resource Center (SUB I room 234, 703-993-2474). You must provide your instructor with a faculty contact sheet from that office outlining the accommodations needed for your disability or learning difference. All academic accommodations must be arranged in advance through the DRC.</p> 
                <h3>cell phones</h3>
                <p>School of Art Policies in accordance with George Mason University policy, turn off all beepers, cellular telephones and other wireless communication devices at the start of class. The instructor of the class will keep his/her cell phone active to assure receipt of any Mason Alerts in a timely fashion; or in the event that the instructor does not have a cell phone, he/she will designate one student to keep a cell phone active to receive such alerts.</p> 
                <h3>commitment to diversity</h3>
                <p>This class will be conducted as an intentionally inclusive community that celebrates diversity and welcomes the participation in the life of the university of faculty, staff and students who reflect the diversity of our plural society. All may feel free to speak and to be heard without fear that the content of the opinions they express will bias the evaluation of their academic performance or hinder their opportunities for participation in class activities. In turn, all are expected to be respectful of each other without regard to race, class, linguistic background, religion, political beliefs, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, veteran’s status, or physical ability.</p> 
                <h3>statement on ethics in teaching and practicing art and design</h3>
                <p>As professionals responsible for the education of undergraduate and graduate art and design students, the faculty of the School of Art adheres to the ethical standards and practices incorporated in the professional Code of Ethics of our national accreditation organization, The National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD).</p> 
                <h3>open studio hours</h3>
                <p>SOA teaching studios are open to students for extended periods of time mornings, evenings and weekends whenever classes are not in progress. Policies, procedures and schedules for studio use are established by the SOA studio faculty and are posted in the studios.</p>
                <h3>official communications via gmu e-mail</h3>

                <h3>attendance policies</h3>
                <p>Students are expected to attend the class periods of the courses for which they register. In-class participation is important not only to the individual student, but also to the class as a whole. Because class participation may be a factor in grading, instructors may use absence, tardiness, or early departure as de facto evidence of nonparticipation. Students who miss an exam with an acceptable excuse may be penalized according to the individual instructor's grading policy, as stated in the course syllabus.</p> 
                <h3>honor code</h3>
